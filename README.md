# TicTacToe

Simple two player Tic Tac Toe game build with NativeScript (Angular 4 and TypeScript) for Android and IOS devices.

The idea of this is to show you how an basic app is built with NativeScript.

Run "tns run android" / "tns run ios" (ios works only on mac) from node.js to run the game. Extended documentation about the project will come soon.

Do not hesitate to contact me if you have any questions.
