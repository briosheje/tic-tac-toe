# TicTacToe

Simple two player Tic Tac Toe game build with NativeScript (Angular 4 and TypeScript) for Android and IOS devices.

The idea of this is to show you how an basic app is built with NativeScript.

Fun "tns run android" / "tns run ios" (ios works only on mac) from node.js to run the game. Extended documentation about the project will come soon
